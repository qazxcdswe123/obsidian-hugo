- Things in the head tag are things that shouldn't be rendered: information about the page and how to process it.
- Things in the body tag are the things that should be displayed: the actual content.
- JavaScript in the body is executed as it is read and as the page is rendered.
- JavaScript in the head is interpreted before anything is rendered.
