## Pipelining
In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), **instruction pipelining** is a technique for implementing [instruction-level parallelism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction-level_parallelism "Instruction-level parallelism") within a single processor. Pipelining attempts to keep every part of the processor busy with some instruction by dividing incoming [instructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code "Machine code") into a series of sequential steps (the eponymous "[pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(computing) "Pipeline (computing)")") performed by different [processor units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit#Structure_and_implementation "Central processing unit") with different parts of instructions processed in parallel.
