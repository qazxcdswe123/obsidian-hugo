## GROUP BY
Used in collaboration with aggregate functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, or `MIN()`. It arranges the result set into groups based on the values of specified columns.

If youâ€™re going to do any grouping / aggregation at all, then you must only SELECT grouped / aggregated columns.

- Multiple Group By: Need multiple columns to be the same.

### HAVING
Like `WHERE` but for `GROUP BY`
