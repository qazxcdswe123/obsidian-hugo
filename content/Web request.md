## GET and POST
Two commands supported by HTTP include **GET** and **POST**. 
GET allows a browser to ask for a page or file in a URL, and POST allows a browser to send additional data to the server that is hidden from the URL. Both of these are **requests** we can make to a server, which will provide a **response** in return.

### HTTP Headers
The keys and values, like `Host: www.example.com` and `Content-Type: text/html`, are known as **HTTP headers**.
