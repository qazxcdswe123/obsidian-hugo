## Decorator pattern
Not to be confused with [the concept of "decorators" in Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_syntax_and_semantics#Decorators "Python syntax and semantics").
[Decorator pattern - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern)
In [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming "Object-oriented programming"), the **decorator pattern** is a [design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern_(computer_science) "Design pattern (computer science)") that allows behavior to be added to an individual [object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science) "Object (computer science)"), dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same [class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_science) "Class (computer science)").

## [[Python]] Decorator
Python decorators were inspired in part by [Java annotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_annotation "Java annotation"), and have a similar syntax; the decorator syntax is pure [syntactic sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar "Syntactic sugar"), using `@` as the keyword:
The `@` symbol in [[Python]] is called a **decorator**, which modifies a function.

[Python syntax and semantics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_syntax_and_semantics#Decorators)
A function returning another function, usually applied as a function transformation using the `@wrapper` syntax. Common examples for decorators are `classmethod()` and `staticmethod()`.
