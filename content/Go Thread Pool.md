1. Define a function that represents the worker. This function should receive tasks from a channel and process them.
2. Create a buffered channel to hold the tasks that need to be executed.
3. Launch a fixed number of [[Goroutine|goroutines]] (workers) that will listen for tasks on the channel and execute them.
4. Send tasks to the channel for the workers to process.
5. Use synchronization mechanisms, such asÂ `sync.WaitGroup`, to ensure that all tasks are completed before the program exits.

## Worker Pools
- [Go by Example: Worker Pools](https://gobyexample.com/worker-pools)

```go
func worker(id int, jobs <-chan int, results chan<- int) {
    for j := range jobs {
        fmt.Println("worker", id, "started  job", j)
        time.Sleep(time.Second)
        fmt.Println("worker", id, "finished job", j)
        results <- j * 2
    }
}
```
