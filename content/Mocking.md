[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object)  

In [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming "Object-oriented programming"), **mock objects** are simulated objects that mimic the behavior of real objects in controlled ways, most often as part of a [software testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing "Software testing") initiative. A programmer typically creates a mock object to test the behavior of some other object, in much the same way that a car designer uses a [crash test dummy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_test_dummy "Crash test dummy") to [simulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation "Simulation") the dynamic behavior of a human in vehicle impacts. The technique is also applicable in [generic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming "Generic programming").
