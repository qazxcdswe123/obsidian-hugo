# The Geometric Series
$\sum _ {i=0}^ {\infty }$$\alpha ^ {i}$ =1+$\alpha$ +$\alpha ^ {2}$ +$\cdots$ =$\frac{1}{1-a}$ for$|a| < 1$

# Infinite Series
Needs to be well-defined  
Fact: limit exists and [[independent]] of order of summation if $\sum _ {i=1}^ {\infty }$$|a_ {i}|$<$\infty$  
The order of summation may matter
