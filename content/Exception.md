> **Exceptions** occur when the processor detects an error condition while executing an instruction, such as division by zero. The processor detects a variety of error conditions including protection violations, page faults, and internal machine faults.

> **Exceptions** are classified as **faults**, **[[trap|traps]]**, or **aborts** depending on the way they are reported and whether the instruction that caused the exception can be restarted without loss of program or task continuity.
