# Package Manager

## npm
`npm config set registry https://registry.npmmirror.com`
### parameters
- `-g`
the `-g` flag is a shorthand for the `global` configuration which sets the package install location to the folder where you installed NodeJS.
This is useful when you need to run the package from the command line instead of using `require()` and import it to your code.

## pnpm
`pnpm config set registry https://registry.npmmirror.com`
