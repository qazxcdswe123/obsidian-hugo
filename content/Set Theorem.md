[[Abstract Algebra]]
## Basic Sets
N := Natural Number  
Z := Integer  
Q := Rational Number  
R := Real Number  
C := Complex Number

## Term
### Disjoint
When two sets have no elements in common, they are said to be disjoint

### Complement
$A ^ { \prime } = \{ x : x \in U \text{ and } x \notin A \}$

### Difference
$A \backslash B = A \cap B ^ { \prime } = \{ x : x \in A \text{ and } x \notin  b\}$

### Relations
Subsets of $A × B$ are called relations

A relation is well-defined if each element in the domain is assigned to a unique element in the range.

### Surjective or onto
满射
each element in B has an A

### Injective or One-to-one
单射
$a_1 \neq a_2 \Leftrightarrow f(a_1) \neq f(a_2)$

### Bijective
双射
A map that is both one-to-one and onto is called bijective.

### Identity Mapping
If S is any set, we will use ids or id to denote the identity mapping from S to itself.  
Define this map by id(s)= s for all s $\in$ S.

### Invertible
A mapping is invertible if and only if it is both one-to-one and onto.
