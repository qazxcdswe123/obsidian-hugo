1. **Spectrum (频谱):** This refers to the range of frequencies that a signal contains. In signal processing, the spectrum of a signal or sound provides a representation of which frequencies are present in the signal. In other words, it's a breakdown of a signal into its frequency components.
2. **Wavelength (波长):** This is the spatial period of a wave, the distance over which the wave's shape repeats. It is usually determined by considering the distance between consecutive points of the same phase, such as crests, troughs, or zero crossings, in a waveform. The standard unit for wavelength is the meter (m).

$$v = f \cdot \lambda$$
- $v$: speed
- $f$: freq
- $\lambda$: wavelength

### Energy Signal (能量信号)
- Finite energy (non-zero)
- Zero average power
- Total energy: area under the squared magnitude of the signal

### Power Signal (功率信号)
- Non-zero average power

## Signal to Noise

$$10 \cdot \lg\left(\frac{S}{N}\right) (dB)$$
