## What

## How
- Compiling eBPF programs into bytecode
- Verifying programs execute safely in a VM before being being loaded at the hook point
- Attaching programs to hook points within the kernel that are triggered by specified events
- Compiling at runtime for maximum efficiency
- Calling helper functions to manipulate data when a program is triggered
- Using maps (key-value pairs) to share data between the user space and kernel space and for keeping state.
