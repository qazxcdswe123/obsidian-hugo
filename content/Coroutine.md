A coroutine is a computer program component that allows execution to be suspended and resumed, generalizing subroutines for cooperative multitasking
In other words, a coroutine is a function that can be paused and resumed at specific points, allowing other code to run in the meantime.

## Coroutine vs Thread
Coroutines are similar to threads, but they are not the same thing. Threads are managed by the [[operating system]] and can run in parallel on multiple processors, while coroutines are managed by the program and run on a single [[thread]]
