can also cure loneliness

Do you think the more you read, the more lonely you are? The more books you read, the more likely you read books other people haven’t, and thus it becomes harder for you to relate to people. Also, reading is something that you do by yourself, and no one will have the same experiences as you do when you read your books. Thoughts?

Reading has made me feel less lonely especially if I like the characters.

For me reading is a replacement for TV not social interaction.

Actually, Writing and reading are famously solitary acts; the loneliness of literature is expected, even embraced. 

But several writers have expanded solitude’s role, from a necessary condition to a central subject.
Lonely characters speak more intimately to the reader, having no ready companion in their own world. The unaccompanied character becomes an avatar for the reader: a pairing that casts the reader as an active explorer, rather than a wallflower in a richer social scene. And it is no wonder that so many books about isolation take place amid gorgeous landscapes. A lonesome character is uniquely attuned to beauty.
These characters are seeking relief from their losses, but they’re also looking to prove that they can make it alone.

## Robinson Crusoe

## Jane Eyre
No character is closer to my heart than Jane, this stubborn, loyal, tiny girl who stares down English storms and hears urgent voices in the wind.
In one of my favorite passages, Jane declares: “There is no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow creatures, and feeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort.” In order to reach that sense of fellowship, Jane must first learn what she is when she’s alone.
