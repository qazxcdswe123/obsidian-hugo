# PCIE
- [PCI Express - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express)
- **Peripheral Component Interconnect Express**
- Style: [Serial communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_communication)
> Every desktop PC [**motherboard**](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/motherboard-definition,5749.html) (opens in new tab)has a number of PCIe slots you can use to add [**GPUs**](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gpu-graphics-card-definition,5742.html)(opens in new tab) (aka video cards aka graphics cards), [**RAID cards**](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/raid-controller-card-definition,5756.html)(opens in new tab)**,** Wi-Fi cards or [**SSD**](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/ssd-solid-state-drive-definition,5763.html)(opens in new tab) (solid-state drive) add-on cards.

## NVME
> The initialism _NVM_ stands for _[non-volatile memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-volatile_memory "Non-volatile memory")_, which is often NAND [flash memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory "Flash memory") that comes in several physical form factors, including [solid-state drives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive "Solid-state drive") (SSDs), PCIe add-in cards, and [M.2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.2 "M.2") cards, the successor to [mSATA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSATA "MSATA") cards. NVM Express, as a logical-device interface, has been designed to capitalize on the low [latency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive_performance_characteristics#Access_time "Hard disk drive performance characteristics") and internal parallelism of solid-state storage devices.

## RAID
- Raid 0
	- splits data into blocks and writes them across multiple drives in the array, offering fast read and write speeds
	- does not provide fault tolerance or redundancy, and problems on any of the disks in the array can result in complete data loss
