[What is AJAX](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_ajax.asp)

## What is AJAX
- AJAX is a technique for accessing web servers from a web page.
- AJAX stands for [[Asynchronous]] [[JavaScript]] And XML.

- It can
	- Read data from a web server - after a web page has loaded
	- Update a web page without reloading the page
	- Send data to a web server - in the background

- AJAX just uses a combination of:
	- A browser built-in `XMLHttpRequest` object (to request data from a web server)
	- [[JavaScript]] and [[HTML]] DOM (to display or use the data)
