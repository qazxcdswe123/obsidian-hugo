We must annotate lifetimes when the lifetimes of references could be related in a few different ways. Rust requires us to annotate the relationships using generic lifetime parameters to ensure the actual references used at runtime will definitely be valid.
*Lifetimes* ensure that references are valid as long as we need them to be. Every reference in Rust has aÂ _lifetime_, which is the scope for which that reference is valid.

```rust
fn main() {
    let string1 = String::from("abcd");
    let string2 = "xyz";

    let result = longest(string1.as_str(), string2);
    println!("The longest string is {}", result);
}

fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}

struct Book<'a> {
    author: &'a str,
    title: &'a str,
}

fn main() {
    let name = String::from("Jill Smith");
    let title = String::from("Fish Flying");
    let book = Book { author: &name, title: &title };

    println!("{} by {}", book.title, book.author);
}
```
