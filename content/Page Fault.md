A page fault is an interruption that occurs when a software program attempts to access a memory block not currently stored in the system's RAM. This [[exception]] tells the [[operating system]] to find the block in [[virtual memory]] so it can be sent from a device's storage to RAM.
The MMU detects the page fault, but the operating system's [kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system) "Kernel (operating system)") handles the exception by making the required page accessible in the physical memory or denying an illegal memory access.
