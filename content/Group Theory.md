# Groups
## Definition
[Group theory - Wikiwand](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Group_theory)  
In mathematics, a group is a set and an operation that combines any two elements of the set to produce a third element of the set, in such a way that the operation is associative, an identity element exists and every element has an inverse.

- associative  
The law of composition is associative.

- the identity element  
There exists an element e ∈ G, called the identity element

- inverse element  
For each element a ∈ G, there exists an inverse element in G, denoted by $a^{−1}$

- abelian or commutative  
A group G with the property that a ◦ b = b ◦ a for all a, b ∈ G is called abelian or commutative.

- Cayley table  
It is often convenient to describe a group in terms of an addition or multiplication table.  
Such a table is called a Cayley table

- the general linear group  
The set of invertible matrices forms a group called the general linear group.

- Order  
The order of a finite group is the number of elements that it contains. 

## Properties
- The identity element in a group G is unique
- Inverses in a group are also unique
- Let G be a group and a and b be any two elements in G. Then the equations $ax = b$ and $xa = b$ have unique solutions in G.
- The right and left cancellation laws are true in groups

## Notation
If the group is $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Z}_n$ , we write the group operation additively and the exponential operation multiplicatively; that is, we write $ng$ instead of $g^n$.

# Subgroups
s## Definition
- A subgroup H of a group G  
We define a subgroup H of a group G to be a subset H of G such that when the group operation of G is restricted to H, H is a group in its own right.

- The trivial subgroup  
The subgroup H = {e} of a group G is called the trivial subgroup.

- Proper subgroup  
A subgroup that is a proper subset of G is called a proper subgroup

## Properties
A subset H of G is a subgroup if and only if it satisfies the following conditions
1. The identity e of G is in H.
2. If h1, h2 ∈ H, then h1, h2∈ H.
3. If h ∈ H, then $h^{-1} ∈ H$.
