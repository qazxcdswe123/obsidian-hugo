[Why do we care about equivalence relations? - Mathematics Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2525064/why-do-we-care-about-equivalence-relations#:~:text=Equivalence%20relations%20are%20important%20because,the%20set%20and%20vice%20versa.)

## Properties
### Reflexive
`x,x`

### Symmetric
`x,y -> y,x`

### Transitive
`x,y y,z -> x,z`

## Notation
We often use the tilde notation $a∼b$ to denote a relation.


## Equivalence Class
Let ∼ be an equivalence relation on a set X and let x ∈ X. Then \[x\] = {y ∈ X : y ∼ x} is called the equivalence class of x  
We will see that an equivalence relation gives rise to a partition via equivalence classes
Also, whenever a partition of a set exists, there is some natural underlying equivalence relation
