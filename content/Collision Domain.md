[[Packet]] collisions happen when two devices send packets simultaneously on a shared network segment.

- Each port on a hub is in the same collision domain
- Each port on a [[network bridge]], switch, or router is in a separate collision domain

Lead to decreased network performance due to packet collisions

## Domain Break Down
Use switches to break up collision domain, and [[VLAN]]/Router to break up [[broadcast domain]].
