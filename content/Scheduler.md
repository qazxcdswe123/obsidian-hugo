## Scheduler
- First Come First Serve (FCFS)
	- automatically executes queued requests and processes in order of their arrival
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Shortest Time-to-Completion First
- Multi-Level Feedback [[Queue]]
	- If a process uses too much CPU time, it will be moved to a lower-priority queue.
	- If a process is I/O-bound or an interactive process, it will be moved to a higher-priority queue.
	- If a process is waiting too long in a low-priority queue and [starving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation_(computer_science) "Starvation (computer science)"), it will be [aged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aging_(scheduling) "Aging (scheduling)") to a higher-priority queue.
- Proportional-share Scheduling
- Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS)
	- CFS basically models an “ideal, precise multi-tasking CPU” on real [[hardware]].
