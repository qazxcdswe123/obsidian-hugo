Here are some other benefits of Manchester [[encoding]]:
- The DC component of the signal carries no information, which makes it possible for standards that usually do not carry power to transmit this information.
- Manchester encoding avoids some of the problems of the non-return-to-zero (NRZ) encoding.
- Manchester encoding is more popular than bipolar and unipolar because errors are easily detectable by missing mid-signal transition.

However, Manchester encoding needs **more bandwidth** than other encodings, such as NRZ.
