[Transcendental Number -- from Wolfram MathWorld](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/TranscendentalNumber.html)
In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), a **transcendental number** is a number that is not [algebraic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_number "Algebraic number")—that is, not the [root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_of_a_function "Zero of a function") of a non-zero [polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial "Polynomial") of finite degree with [rational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number "Rational number") [coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient "Coefficient"). The best known transcendental numbers are [π](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi "Pi") and [e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant))
A number that is not [algebraic](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/AlgebraicNumber.html) is said to be transcendental.
