  let is_empty = function [] -> true | _ -> false

  (** [push x s] pushes [x] onto the top of [s]. *)
  let push x s = x :: s

  (** [Empty] is raised when an operation cannot be applied
      to an empty stack. *)

  (** [peek s] is the top element of [s].
      Raises [Empty] if [s] is empty. *)
