title: C++ explicit

- `explict` 
[Src](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/use-of-explicit-keyword-in-cpp/)
**Explicit Keyword in C++** is used to mark constructors to not implicitly convert types in C++. It is optional for constructors that take exactly one argument and works on constructors(with single argument) since those are the only constructors that can be used in type casting. 
Avoid implicit conversion, as it is hard to track and maintain.
