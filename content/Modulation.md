## Modulation
Modulation is the process of adding information to a carrier signal to convert data into radio waves or other forms of electromagnetic signals.  
The carrier signal is a steady waveform with a constant height and frequency.  
Modulation is used to transmit multiple channels of information through a single communication medium, using frequency-division multiplexing (FDM)

## Demodulation
Demodulation is the process of extracting the original signal from a modulated carrier wave.

### Coherent Demodulation
 the receiver recreates the **exact carrier wave** (with the same **frequency and phase**) to extract the original information from the received signal.

## Baseband
It is the original, unmodulated form of a signal, which can be either analog or digital  
In the Fourier domain, a baseband signal is a signal that occupies the frequency range from 0 Hz up to a certain cutoff
