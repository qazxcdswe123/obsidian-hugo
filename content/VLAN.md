A virtual LAN (VLAN) is a [[broadcast domain]] that is partitioned and isolated in the network at [[network layer]] 2. So it is possible to have multiple networks (4096) in a physical network, each independent of the other ones.

Each VLAN network is identified by a number often called _tag_. Network packages are then _tagged_ to identify which virtual network they belong to.
