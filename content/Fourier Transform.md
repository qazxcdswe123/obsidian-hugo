The Fourier transform is a mathematical formula that transforms a signal sampled in **time or space** to the same signal sampled in **temporal or spatial frequency**. 
In signal processing, the Fourier transform can reveal important characteristics of a signal, namely, its frequency components.

## Use Cases
- Decomposing frequency from sound.
- If earthquake vibrations can be separated into "ingredients" (vibrations of different speeds & amplitudes), buildings can be designed to avoid interacting with the strongest ones.
- If sound waves can be separated into ingredients (bass and treble frequencies), we can boost the parts we care about, and hide the ones we don't. The crackle of random noise can be removed. Maybe similar "sound recipes" can be compared (music recognition services compare recipes, not the raw audio clips).
- If computer data can be represented with oscillating patterns, perhaps the least-important ones can be ignored. This "lossy [[compression]]" can drastically shrink file sizes (and why JPEG and MP3 files are much smaller than raw .bmp or .wav files).
- If a radio wave is our signal, we can use filters to listen to a particular channel. In the smoothie world, imagine each person paid attention to a different ingredient: Adam looks for apples, Bob looks for bananas, and Charlie gets cauliflower (sorry bud).
