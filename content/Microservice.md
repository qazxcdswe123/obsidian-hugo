Microservices are an architectural and organizational approach to software development, where software is composed of small independent services that communicate over **well-defined APIs**.

1. Easier and faster code updates, enabling new features or functionality without affecting the entire application.
2. Different technology stacks and programming languages can be used for different components.
3. Components can be scaled independently, reducing waste and cost associated with scaling entire applications.
4. Improved fault isolation and resilience.
