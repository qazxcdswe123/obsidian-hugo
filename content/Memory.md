- Relationship between stack and heap
> In a multi-threaded application, each thread will have its own stack. But, all the different threads will share the heap. Because the different threads share the heap in a multi-threaded application, this also means that there has to be some coordination between the threads so that they donâ€™t try to access and manipulate the same piece(s) of memory in the heap at the same time.
