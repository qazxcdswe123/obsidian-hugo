## General
Good practices for unit testing include:
- Creating tests for all publicly exposed functions, including class constructors and operators.
- Covering all code paths and checking both trivial and edge cases, including those with incorrect input data (see [negative testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_testing)).
- Assuring that each test works independently and doesn't prevent other tests from execution.
- Organizing tests in a way that the order in which you run them doesn't affect the results.
