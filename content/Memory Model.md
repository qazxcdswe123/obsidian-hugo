> In computing, a **memory model** describes the interactions of [threads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computer_science) "Thread (computer science)") through [memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_(computing) "Memory (computing)") and their shared use of the [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(computing) "Data (computing)").
> Memory model is a formal specification of how the memory system will appear to the programmer, eliminating the gap between the behavior expected by the programmer and the actual behavior supported by a system
