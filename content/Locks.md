# Locks

## Spinlock
In [software engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering "Software engineering"), a **spinlock** is a [lock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science) "Lock (computer science)") that causes a [thread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computer_science) "Thread (computer science)") trying to acquire it to simply wait in a loop ("spin") while repeatedly checking whether the lock is available. Since the thread remains active but is not performing a useful task, the use of such a lock is a kind of [busy waiting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_waiting "Busy waiting").
