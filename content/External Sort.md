First sort, then merge, like a [[Merge Sort]].  
IO: $2N * (1 + \lceil log_{2}^{N} \rceil)$  
Sort in input buffer, write it to output buffer. When output buffer is full, write it to disk.
- Optimizations:
	- Rather than just sorting individual pages, letâ€™s load B pages and sort them all at once into a single sorted run.
	- Merge more than 2 sorted runs together at a time.
