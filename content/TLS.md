## TLS Vs. SSL Handshakes
[SSL, or Secure Sockets Layer](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-ssl/), was the original security protocol developed forÂ [HTTP](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/hypertext-transfer-protocol-http/). SSL was replaced by TLS, or Transport Layer Security, some time ago. SSL handshakes are now called TLS handshakes, although the "SSL" name is still in wide use.
