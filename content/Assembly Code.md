## General
To understand:
- How values are stored and accessed. This is typically via some form of registers.
- The instructions that operate on data.
- The conventions used for passing values as arguments to functions and for returning them as results.
- The conventions for how registers are preserved during function calls â€”for example, with some registers designated as caller saved, and others as callee saved
