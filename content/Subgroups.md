# Subgroups

## 判定子群
群 G 的非空子集 H 是 G 的子群,当且仅当 H 同时满足以下条件:
- 若 a, b ∈ H,则 ab ∈ H;
- 若 a ∈ H,则 $a^{−1}$∈ H。  
or
- 对任意 a, b ∈ H, $ab^{−1}$∈ H

## Definition
- A subgroup H of a group G  
We define a subgroup H of a group G to be a subset H of G such that when the group operation of G is restricted to H, H is a group in its own right.

- The trivial subgroup  
The subgroup H = {e} of a group G is called the trivial subgroup.

- Proper subgroup  
H is a subgroup of G and $H \neq G$ ($H \subset G$)

## Properties
A subset H of G is a subgroup if and only if it satisfies the following conditions
1. The identity e of G is in H.
2. If h1, h2 ∈ H, then h1, h2∈ H.
3. If h ∈ H, then $h^{-1} ∈ H$.
