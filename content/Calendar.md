The **Gregorian calendar** is the [calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar "Calendar") used in most parts of the world. It was introduced on February 24 with a papal bull, and went into effect in October 1582 by [Pope Gregory XIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Gregory_XIII "Pope Gregory XIII") as a modification of, and replacement for, the [Julian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar "Julian calendar").

The principal change was to space [leap years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year "Leap year") differently so as to make the average calendar year 365.2425 days long, more closely approximating the 365.2422-day ['tropical' or 'solar' year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_year "Tropical year") that is determined by the Earth's revolution around the Sun.
