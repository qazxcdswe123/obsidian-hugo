# Relational databases
- In SQL, we choose the types of data that each column will store.
- check the schema, or design, of our new table with `.schema`
- SQL supports many functions that we can use to count and summarize data:
	-   `AVG`
	-   `COUNT`
	-   `DISTINCT`
	-   `LOWER`
	-   `MAX`
	-   `MIN`
	-   `UPPER`
- Since each show may have more than one genre, we can have more than one row per show in our genres table, known as a **one-to-many** relationship.
