## What
A [probabilistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_algorithm "Randomized algorithm") [data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure "Data structure") that allows $O(\log n)$ average complexity for search and insertion within a ordered sequence of n elements.
Not [[Cache]] friendly.

## How
The idea: create multiple layers so that we can **skip** some nodes.

## Why
Search in a sorted linked list better than $O(n)$ time
