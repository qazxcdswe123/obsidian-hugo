- Notations:
	- $[T]$: Number of pages in table T
	- $\rho_T$: The number of records on each page of T
	- $|T|$: The total number of records in table T, $|T| = [T] \times \rho_T$
 
## Simple Nested Loop Join
- IO Count: $[R] + |R|[S]$

## Page Nested Loop Join
- IO Count: $[R] + [R][S]$
	- $S$ should be the smaller table to minimize the IO cost.
- Read in every single page in $S$ for every single page of $R$

## Block Nested Loop Join
We have $B$ buffer pages, give $B-2$ pages for $R$ and match $S$ against every record  in the buffer.
- IO Conut: $[R] + \frac{[R]}{B-2}[S]$

## Grace Hash Join
GraceÂ hash join is a type of hash join algorithm used in database systems to join two large tables that cannot fit in memory.
