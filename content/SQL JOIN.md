## Cross Join
Essentially a [[Cross Product]]

```sql
SELECT âˆ—
FROM courses, enrollment; 
```

## Inner Join
```sql
SELECT column_name(s) 
FROM tablel
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1_column_name = table2_column_name; 
```

The `table1_column.name` = `table2_column.name` is the join condition.  
**The default `JOIN` Method**

## Left Join

## Full Join
The full outer join which guarantees that all rows from each table will appear in the output.

## Natural Join
When the same column name match, the join the table
