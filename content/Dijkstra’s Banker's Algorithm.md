- [Banker's algorithm - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_algorithm)
- A resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra
- Idea: First give resources to those need less resources, like a [[Greedy]] algorithm.

- We need to know the **available resources, resources needed and available**.
- If safe, we give, then recycle the resources from the finished process.
