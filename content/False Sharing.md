## Common problems
A common problem in modern architectures with multiprocessor caches is called [false sharing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_sharing). This occurs when each individual processor is attempting to use data in another memory region and attempts to store it in the same _cache line_. This causes the cache line -- which contains data another processor can use -- to be overwritten again and again. Effectively, different threads make each other wait by inducing cache misses in this situation.
