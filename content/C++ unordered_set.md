## What is
Unordered sets are containers that store unique elements in no particular order, and which allow for fast retrieval of individual elements based on their value.

## How to Use
- `find()`
The `unordered_set::find()` function is a built-in function in [[C++ STL]] which is used to search for an element in the container. It returns an iterator to the element, if found else, it returns an iterator pointing to `unordered_set::end()`.

- `insert()`
- `earse()`
- `count()`
Returns the number of elements with key that compares equal to the specified argument `key`, which is either 1 or 0 since this container does not allow duplicates.
