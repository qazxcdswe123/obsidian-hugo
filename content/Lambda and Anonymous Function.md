> In computer programming, an anonymous function (function literal, lambda abstraction, lambda function, lambda expression or block) is a function definition that is not bound to an identifier. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function)

Bound to variable but not identifier, no parentheses or `return` keyword

Typically lambdas are used to encapsulate a few lines of code that are passed to algorithms or [[asynchronous]] functions.

## Example
- [[Java Lambda]]
- [[C++ Lambda Expression]]
- [[Python Lambda]]
