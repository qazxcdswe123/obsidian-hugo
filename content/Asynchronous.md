[Asynchronous I/O - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_I/O)  
In computer science, **asynchronous I/O** (also **non-sequential I/O**) is a form of [input/output](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output "Input/output") processing that permits other [processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing) "Process (computing)") to continue before the [transmission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transmission "Data transmission") has finished.

# Programming
_asynchronous_ actions. In other words, actions that we initiate now, but they finish later.
