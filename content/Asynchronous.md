# Overview
- [Asynchrony (computer programming) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchrony_(computer_programming))
- Asynchronous routines are able to “pause” while waiting on their ultimate result and let other routines run in the meantime.
- [Asynchronous code](https://realpython.com/python-async-features/), through the mechanism above, facilitates concurrent execution. To put it differently, asynchronous code gives the look and feel of concurrency.

## Asynchrony I/O
In computer science, **asynchronous I/O** (also **non-sequential I/O**) is a form of [input/output](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output "Input/output") processing that permits other [processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing) "Process (computing)") to continue before the [transmission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transmission "Data transmission") has finished.
