## End-to-End Principle
- [End-to-End principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_principle)
- Need two end points' joint effort to make communication correct and complete, relay in middle can only check headers but not data. You need an end-to-end check, such as [[Hashing]] or [[Checksum]] to check data integrity.
- Example:
	- File transfer
	- Bittorrent
	- Link reliability (Wireless vs Wired).
