# Express
Express is a routing and middleware web framework that has minimal functionality of its own: An Express application is essentially a series of middleware function calls.
_Middleware_ functions are functions that have access to the [request object](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#req) (`req`), the [response object](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res) (`res`), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named `next`.
