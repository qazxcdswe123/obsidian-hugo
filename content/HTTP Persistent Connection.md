**[HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP "HTTP") persistent connection**, also called **HTTP keep-alive**, or **HTTP connection reuse**, is the idea of using a single [TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol "Transmission Control Protocol") connection to send and receive multiple [HTTP requests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol "Hypertext Transfer Protocol")/responses, as opposed to opening a new connection for every single request/response pair. The newer [HTTP/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2 "HTTP/2") protocol uses the same idea and takes it further to allow multiple concurrent requests/responses to be multiplexed over a single connection.
