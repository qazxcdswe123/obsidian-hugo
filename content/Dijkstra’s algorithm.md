## What
Just like [[Prim's Algorithm]], the MST is also the shortest path.  
It is also a greedy algorithm.

## How
Same as prim's algorithm: ![[Prim's Algorithm#How]]  
Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm takes $O(V^{2})$ time, with the time dominated by the time spent in priority queue.

## Links
- [[Bellman-Ford algorithm]], also a shortest path algorithm.
