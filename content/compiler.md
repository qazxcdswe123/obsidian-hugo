## Normal Compiler
- Preprocessing phase [C preprocessor - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_preprocessor)
	- A preprocessing step performs macro substitution on program text, inclusion of other source files, and conditional compilation.
- Compilation phase
- Assembly phase
- Linking phase

## JIT Compiler
- [compilation - What does a just-in-time (JIT) compiler do? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/95635/what-does-a-just-in-time-jit-compiler-do?rq=1)  
This is in contrast to a traditional compiler that compiles **all** the code to machine language **before** the program is first run.
