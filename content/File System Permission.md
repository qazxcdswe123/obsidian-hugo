[File-system permissions - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File-system_permissions)  
Two types of permissions are widely available: traditional Unix file system permissions and **[access-control lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access-control_list "Access-control list") (ACLs)** which are capable of more specific control.

## Traditional Unix Permissions
- The read bit adds 4 to its total (in binary 100),
- The write bit adds 2 to its total (in binary 010), and
- The execute bit adds 1 to its total (in binary 001).
