## Virtual Memory
Each [[process]] has the same uniform view of memory, which is known as its virtual address space.  
In [[Linux]], the topmost region of the address space is reserved for code and data in the [[operating system]] that is common to all processes. The lower region of the address space holds the code and data defined by the user's [[process]].
