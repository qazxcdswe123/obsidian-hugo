Functional dependency is a constraint that exists between two attributes in a database management system ([[DBMS]]) where one attribute determines another attribute.
There are mainly four types of functional dependencies in DBMS: multivalued, trivial, non-trivial, and transitive. A non-trivial functional dependency occurs when **A->B** holds true where B is not a subset of A
